Light budget
File: light_budget
Annual light budget (cumulative solar radiation) reaching the water surface.
Processing steps: As per Clark et al. (in press). Daily incident solar radiation was modelled assuming a cloud-free sky (Suri and Hofierka 2004). Sea ice data (AMSR-E sea ice concentration) were used as a mask: if sea ice was present on a given day then the solar radiation reaching the ocean surface was assumed to be zero. The annual light budget for a given pixel was therefore calculated as the sum of daily solar radiation values on all days when sea ice was not present. The values here are the mean annual light budget over the 2002/03 to 2010/11 austral summer seasons (1-Jul to 30-Jun). Calculations were made on the AMSR-E 6.25km polar stereographic grid, and then interpolated to the 0.1-degree rectangular grid using triangle-based linear interpolation.

Currently there are three products: (Skin) Sea Surface  Temperature (SST); Chlorophyll-a (Chl a); and Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490nm (K490). The SST data are derived from data from the AVHRR sensor on the NOAA series satellites received at AIMS and currently covers the period from June 2003 to present. This dataset will be expanded back to 1990 in the near future.  The Chl a and K490 ( an ocean turbidity proxy) are derived from data from the SeaWiFS sensor on board the Orbview-2 satellite. These products are available for the period January 1998 to August 2005.
The datasets will also be augmented with data from the MODIS sensor on the EOS satellites. This data will be sourced from NASA for the period prior to installation of the AIMS X-band ground-station and then from directly received data.</t></si><si><t>http://data.gov.au/api/3/action/package_show?id=aims-remote-sensing-data-great-barrier-reef-subset</t></si><si><t>2014-11-02 07:27:52.42554</t></si><si><t>2014-10-24 06:24:30</t></si><si><t>2014-10-29 12:03:46</t></si><si><t>538bc6c1-9a67-41fc-8e8c-1c68e948f018</t></si><si><t>Australian Institute of Marine Science</t></si><si><t>MODIS derived Total Suspended Materials (TSM) datasets</t></si><si><t>The datasets measure the Total Suspended Materials (TSM) concentrations of ocean surface waters.

The report describes products, outputs and outcomes of the three-dimensional (3D) visualisation component of the Great Artesian Basin Water Resource Assessment (the Assessment). This report specifically encompasses the following topics associated with the 3D visualisation component:

-	The requirements and potential benefits
-	The effective datasets
-	Methodology used in content creation
-	The output datasets
-	Discussions regarding outcomes, limitations and future directions

The Assessment is designed to assist water managers in the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) to meet National Water Initiative commitments.

The key datasets of the 3D visualisation component include contact surfaces between major aquifers and aquitards with coverage of significant portions of the GAB, well lithostratigraphic and wire-line data and hydrogeochemistry produced by State and National Agencies. These datasets are manipulated within GOCAD® to develop the 3D visualisation component and communication products for use by end users to assist visualisation and conceptualisation of the GAB. While many options have been investigated for distribution of these 3D products, 2D screen captures and content delivery via the Geoscience Australia (GA) World Wind 3D data viewer will be the most efficient and effective products.

This 3D visualisation should be viewed in reference to the "Lexicon of the lithostratigraphic and hydrogeological units of the Great Artesian Basin and its Cenozoic cover" report (Radke et al., 2012) also created as part of the Assessment.

A reanalysis dataset typically extends over several decades or longer, and covers the entire globe from the Earth's surface to well above the stratosphere.  Reanalysis products are used extensively in climate research and services, including for monitoring and comparing current climate conditions with those of the past, identifying the causes of climate variations and change, and preparing climate predictions. Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and Japanese Meterological Agency (JMA) have produced new reanalysis datasets that, in total, span 1871 to present. It is crucial to our scientific understanding of climate variability and change that these new datasets be validated and compared with each other and with the underlying observations. International working groups of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS, the climate element of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems) and the World Climate Research Program, and the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstruction over the Earth (ACRE) initiative need a community portal to exchange quickly and disseminate publicly results of such intercomparisons. NOAA's own mission and strategic goals regarding reanalyzes, as well as its leading role in the US Global Change Research Program, GCOS, WCRP, and ACRE, make NOAA the logical and obvious choice to serve a website dedicated to improving understanding of the international reanalysis datasets, including those recently generated by NOAA, the 20th Century Reanalysis and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis.  The new website "reanalyses.org" will serve as a central portal for Reanalysis Intercomparison and Observations (RIO) by NOAA, NASA, ECMWF, JMA, and national and international scientists. The website should be outside the "noaa.gov" domain. It will help NOAA and the international scientific community to improve the climate science and services that reanalyzes underpin.

Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). This map shows the temperature of Earth's lands during the nighttime. Temperature is a measure of how warm or cold an object is. During the day, the Sun's rays warm Earth's lands. At night, the lands typically cool off. Landscapes cool off at night because they release their warmth to air above while they are no longer receiving sunlight. Scientists can measure the temperature of Earth's lands from space using instruments carried on satellites. Scientists want to know the land's temperature for many important reasons. For example, in places where it is too hot or too cold food crops may die. Temperature also influences weather and climate patterns. So, mapping the temperature of Earth's lands helps scientists to better understand our world.  The colors on these maps represent temperature patterns of the top millimeter (or skin) of the land surface including bare land, snow or ice cover, urban areas, and cropland or forest canopy as observed by MODIS in clear-sky conditions for the time period indicated. Yellow shows the warmest temperatures (up to 45°C) and light blue shows the coldest temperatures (down to -25°C). Black means "no data."</t></si><si><t>2014-10-01 14:13:13.55038</t></si><si><t>dg3h-giyg</t></si><si><t>Tropical surface current velocities (HOLD) Broken Link!</t></si><si><t>currents;oceans;climate;JPL;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;Nino;NASA;Science Mission Directorate;Sea surface;paleoclimate;terrestrial hydrosphere;current velocity</t></si><si><t>These data are estimates of the horizontal near-surface currents of the Tropical Pacific ocean, from October 1992 to current.</t></si><si><t>2014-10-01 14:13:15.494534</t></si><si><t>4867-iiet</t></si><si><t>2012-07-19 00:00:00</t></si><si><t>On Earth</t></si><si><t>Goddard Space Flight Center;biology;oceans;climate;JPL;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;NASA;biosphere;Atmosphere;GSFC</t></si><si><t>MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites.

These data will improve our understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere.
